AutiSPOT- ‘Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Diagnosis and Reinforcement by Machine Learning and Neural Networks’
(Major Project)

A full-fledged application that includes:
•	Diagnosis and Prediction of toddlers and adults to determine if they fall under the Autism spectrum using various machine learning algorithms.
•	Identifying autism using Deep learning & Neural Networks via Face Recognition Mechanism.
•	Navigation tools to help facilitate users to find nearest care centers by means of Google Maps.
•	Intuitive User Interface to assist disabled people to learn basic daily chores.
•	A social Networking medium specially designed for community that falls within the ASD category.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the major mental disorders in terms of neurodevelopment brain functions. The three types of symptoms which Autistic patients exhibit are: social development, difficulty in communication and unusual behavior. Unfortunately, based on the nature of ASD, it is difficult to diagnose. However, applications can be a tremendous help in monitoring,reinforcement and the treatment of patients. This work presents an architectural solution that enables the interoperability between an autistic person and caregivers to contribute on the treatment and monitoring to persons with ASD.
